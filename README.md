netbeans-gradle-javaee-project
==============================

A NetBeans plugin to provide Java EE support to Gradle projects.  This builds on top of the standard Gradle plugin for NetBeans, but contains dependencies on the Java EE NetBeans modules that might be restrictive for Gradle projects that don't use Java EE.

I created the plugin to address the issues I came across writing enterprise applications using Gradle.   I am doing this in my spare time, so I can't promise a rapid response.  But, I'm happy to accept pull requests if you want to chip in.

Feel free to add issues for important items you think should be addressed.
